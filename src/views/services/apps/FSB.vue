                        <p>A feature rich, API driven mobile app with a high quality and animated UI enables members to access vital resources and expertise that helps run their businesses. Membership is also managed via the app, with a profile page and interactive membership card. An interactive text based chatbot provides a seamless way to interact with all of the apps features, which includes booking to attend local events. A timeline logging all app interactions helps the FSB to provide support where it is most needed.
