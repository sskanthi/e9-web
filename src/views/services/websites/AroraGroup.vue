                        <p>Our rationale behind the Arora Group’s website was to capture the essence of the business in the way that the brand appeals to clients’ sensibilities. Given the Arora Group’s vast number of business dealings, such as Hotels, Property and Construction, and the number of individual pages that had to be created within each division, it was challenging to ensure that the pages were comprehensive but did not seem out of place or overwhelm the user at any point. </p>
