                        <p class="lead">We have had the chance to work with Telefonica O2 on multiple occasions to deliver innovative products, one of which is the O2 Wifi website. With O2 Wifi being provided through 15,000 hotspots across more than 120 restaurants and venues in the UK this was an exciting challenge.

                        <p>Since O2 as a brand is already well established, designing the website according to their branding was fairly uncomplicated with branding and design guides available to us. However, It was important to reflect the capabilities of O2 Wifi, being a free to use service with no barriers and clearly explain the benefits of integrating with O2 Wifi to venue partners.</p>
