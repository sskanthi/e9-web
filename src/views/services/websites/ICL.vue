To that effect, we have put in our efforts and our collective experience as a team to implement the latest design techniques and have even attempted to put our own spin on it. </p>

                        <p>We inferred that establishing the illusion of depth and dimension has become a very popular concept in the web design world off-late, and one of the best ways to implement this has been to portray the appearance of three-dimensional objects despite the flat two-dimensional medium of a website. Additionally, shadows have also come into play and are applied to artefacts within website design to reinforce depth illusion and to breathe life into it. The aspect that we brought these insights and our creativity into the most on the InterContinental London website were the visuals. </p>

                        <p>Our approach to recreating depth perception was to blend shadows and the reflection of images to get the best of both effects in an exclusively realised perspective. The result was unlike any work done in the past, because we had succeeded in employing the colours of the image within its own shadow to intensify the depth and give rise to a uniquely layered point of view. We leveraged this combination of effects to create the impression of a realm beyond the screen, which was further enhanced by our implementation of parallax scrolling, to give the user a fully immersive experience of viewing the website.</p>
